# Hugo Language Switcher in Bootstrap

- Hugo language switcher test site, ported from: https://jemmsuk.github.io/hugo-language-switcher/
- Language switcher lands user on the same page but in the chosen language (instead of directing user to homepage for that language)
- Thanks to [@jmooring](https://github.com/jmooring) for the initial code: https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/changing-languages-and-remaining-on-the-same-page/44031/3

- To use:
  
1. install Hugo: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
2. Clone this repo
3. run: Hugo Server
