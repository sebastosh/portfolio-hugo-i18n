Languages shape how we see the world. Each one carries its own rhythms, expressions, and cultural depth, connecting people across history and geography. From the structured beauty of French to the dynamic flow of Japanese, languages are more than communication—they’re identity, storytelling, and connection. Hugo has always been fascinated by languages, seeing them as bridges between minds and cultures. Learning a new language isn't just about words; it's about understanding perspectives, embracing diversity, and unlocking new ways to think.
